# Editing Images

Editing images in python is well, just a pain. I will not go into depth because of all the intricacies but rather I'll give you a rundown.

The library I used for this is PIL this is really just a matter of reading and experimenting a bit so I'll leave this part to you.

This will probably be the most complex and tedious part of the entire project.

The only thing I will advise is that if you are considering drawing complex images that you use asynchronous code so you don't block other parts.
