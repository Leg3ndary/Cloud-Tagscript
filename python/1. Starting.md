# Starting

Firstly, create an account on https://repl.it and open up a new project with python as its language!

Next you will need the following imports

```py
import os
from flask import Flask, send_file, jsonify
from threading import Thread
import urllib
import asyncio
from PIL import Image, ImageFont, ImageDraw

# This is solely for the database I'm using
import pymongo
```

Next you'll need to create the flask application, this is what you'll actually be adding endpoints too...

```py
app = Flask('')
@app.route('/')	
def home():
	return "API working"

@app.route('/image/show', methods=['GET'])
def dev_show():
    add_uses()
    return send_file('example_image.png')

def run():
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)

server = Thread(target=run)
server.start()
```

First we initiate the Flask instance, we then add its default route, which just says API working.

Next we add another route where we return an image called example_image.png

**This is the first example of a way to save data, you can save data when the route is called and then use it later**

We then define a function and use a thread to run it.

This is the barebones of making an API for our purposes!

Next make sure you run it and if everythings worked, you should see API working and above of that an url. Take that and save it somewhere, it will be your base url and you will need it later on.

Should look something like the above!
