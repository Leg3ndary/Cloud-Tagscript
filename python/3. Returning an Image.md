# Returning an Image

To return an image we simply have to use an method from flask called send_file `from flask import Flask, send_file, jsonify`

This just allows us to return an image in which discord will try to cache.

Everytime method should technically have this if you actually want an embed to pop up

For example:

```py
@app.route('/add/<string:word>/<int:unix>', methods=['GET'])
def _add(word, unix):
    edit_word(word)
    return send_file('dirty_shell.png')
```

I edit a word here and then send the image which the above function actually edited.

Filepaths should just be used like normal

```py
# Something in the Images Folder
return send_file('images/Shell_Carl.png')
```
